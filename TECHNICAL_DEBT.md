# Technical debt

Delete a section when it's paid — git history is the audit trail, not a
strikethrough graveyard. No `~~item~~`, no `✅ DONE` subsections: when an item is
resolved, remove it. Section numbers are stable (gaps are fine; never renumber).
Keep each entry specific enough to act on without re-deriving the context.

## 3. Consciously accepted — do NOT "fix" these without a new reason

Recorded so a future pass doesn't burn effort churning them (each was reviewed
and deliberately left):

- **`useMatchesDossierQueries.ts` (~696 lines) and `useMatchesNarrow.ts` (~539)**
  exceed the 500-line soft cap, but the bulk is a single cohesive dense function
  each — exactly what the file-size rule exempts. The narrow file's shared types +
  state factory were already split out (`matchesNarrow.types` / `.state`);
  fragmenting the remaining filter/query math would hurt cohesion for a number.
- **Report-only cyclomatic-complexity warnings** (`load()` 14, `valueLabel` 11):
  the complexity lefthook step is REPORT-ONLY for a reason — these are branchy by
  nature (an `allSettled` boot coordinator). Refactor only if a real
  readability/bug problem surfaces.
- **The remaining `as unknown as` casts** (`mountWidget` partial-dossier fixture +
  the `mount()` overload cast, the ECharts series union) are legitimate
  type-boundary casts. The one genuine type-lie (`enterEditMode` cast from
  KeyboardEvent to MouseEvent) was fixed.
- **External CI flakes** — the schemathesis random-seed failures on the PUT
  settings endpoints and the WebKit `match-detail-panel` timeout are
  non-deterministic and not fixable in code; re-run the job.
