# Technical Debt

Living inventory of known technical debt in the Recall codebase. Each
item has the same four-section shape so they can be triaged, scoped,
and worked off independently. Update this file whenever debt is added
(record it the same week, with the same rigor) or paid down (delete
the section — not "strikethrough", not "✅", just delete it; git
history is the audit trail).

## How to read this file

Each item carries a **size** estimate that combines coding effort with
review/test/release surface area:

| Size | Rough effort | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **S**  | < 2 hours | A single-file rename, one Makefile var, one config flip. |
| **M**  | ½–2 days | A refactor inside one package; new test file; small DI seam. |
| **L**  | 2–5 days | Multi-package refactor; new abstraction with migrations; CI rewiring. |
| **XL** | 1–2 weeks | Rewriting a monolith; introducing a new runtime dependency; reshaping an entire layer. |

A **plan** is a sequence of *small, independently mergeable* steps. If
a step needs a release or a contributor handoff, that's marked in line.
Anything that has to land atomically is called out.

The list is ordered by *risk × cost-to-fix-later*, not by size. The
top items are the ones most likely to bite if left alone. Pay them off
first.

<!-- All inventoried items in this list have been paid down. Add the
     next debt finding below; keep numbering stable and never renumber
     prior items. -->
